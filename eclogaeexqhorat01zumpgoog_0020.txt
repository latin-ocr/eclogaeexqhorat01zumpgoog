The post himself was therefore freeborn (ingenuas); and this
fact, considering the great number cf free'dmen who lived at
Rome, and rose to wealth and influence, was of itself something
to be proud of (compare Sat. i. 6, 7.) Horace aclrnowledges his
humble birth; but liis education, he says, was equal to that os
one destined for the highest position in society, although his

= father would 'have been satisfied is his son had followed the

sarne' calling as himself-namely, thatof a condor (Sat. i. 6, 86) 5
or, as Suetonius in Horace's life more fully says, aoniam
coactor ,· that is, an agent of the argentarii, who, for a certain per·
centage or commission, collected from purchasers at auctions the
money due for what they had bought. The father, however, was
besides the possessor of a small estate near Venusia.

The school at Venusia, though the town was a considerable
one, and wealthy, was yet but second-rate. It was good enough,
however, for boys intended for handicrafls or a mercantile life,
writing and arithmetic were taught; and even the higher class
of citizens-the magni centuriones, as the poet calls them (Sat. i. 6, ·
⁷3)-wers content with it. But young Flaccus was tehen by his
father ιο Rome, to be educated there. The father himself letthis
home, settled in the capital, and accompanied his son to all tha
teachers whom be attended. The poet praises this conduct as
very selfsacrificing, and considers himself fortunate in having
been rhus preserved from the follies and seductione to which
youth is liable in a large city: (compare the whole of Satira 6,
book i.) Horace studied in Rome Latin and Greek grammar3
and afterwards, under the same teachers, rhetoric. He mentions
. (Epist. ii. l, 71) that, when a boy, he attended the school of the
grammarian Orbilius, who used to dictate passages from the
writings of the old Latin poet Livius Andronicus, and give gram·
matical prelections on rhem. He also states (Epist. ii. 42), that
Homer was explained tc him, no doubt bya Greek grammarian.
In such studies Horace's life passed on, till it became time for
him to decide whether he would enter into publio life or not.
To do so he had ιο become either an advocate or a soldier.
He was not inclined ιο adopt either profession3 for the latter,
indeed, he probably had not physical strength. Resides, she
Roman state seemed falling ιο pisces: the civil war carne on,
then the murder of Caesar. Horace withdraw from this scene
of confusion; and alter the fashion cf high-born Roman youths,
went to Athens to pursue his studies, especially in philosophy.
His father appears to have been dead by this nme. ‘l'he most
distinguished philosopher then teaohing at Athens was Cratippus
me peripatetic, to whom Cicero had sent his son. Horace men·

tions (Epist. ii. 2, to) that he had attended the discourses of a
peripatetic-probably Cratippus. He felt happy in the quietand

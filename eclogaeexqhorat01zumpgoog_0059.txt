Roman would think who read of the ‘proud rule,’ superbos facea)

censis, who, in the year 46 u.c., when Julius Caesar had cou uered
the Pom ciart party in Africa, put an end to his own lise at ticu,
because lie was resolved not tollive under the dominion of a single

taken prisoner by the Carthaoinians tn the year 2⁵0 u.c., is cele·
brated for tho faithfulness wilh which he kept a promise made to
his enemies, and for his devotion to his country's good. Compare

man of this nante, M. Aemilius Scaurus, consul in 115 a. c. After

'l'hough he was ιο poor that he wrought with his hands for his daily
bread, yet when the Samnites offered him presente, he, in the true
spirit of the primitive Romans, rejected them. The epithet iu-
comptr's-rupillt's, ‘with his uncombed or shuggy hair,’ is intended
to be laudatory, as indicating that Curius was unacquaiuted with
the arts of tlte toilet, and hleedless of the eustoms of relined society.

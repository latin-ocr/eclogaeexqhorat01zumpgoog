friend and imitator of Maecenas He might, like him, being
rich and a favourite of Augustus, hare attained to the highest

N uanus argento color est avaris
Abdito terris, inimice lamnae
Crispe Sallusti, nisi temperato

Splendeat usu.
Vivet extento Proculeius aevo ὅ

Notus in fratres animi paterni3

1. Nullus color est. Silrer has no glitter so long as it lies con-
cealed in the bowels of the earth: in the same way money is use-
less, ts kept shut up in a chest, and not emended-2. Lamnae,
shortened form ol laminae: properly, ‘a plate of metalff bere used
contemptuously os stamped or coined money. Connect the clauses
thus: inimice lamnae, ariri-splendeat, ‘who hatest money, unless
it shines,' dac-5. Proculeius was, in rank, merely a Roman
eques, but a man of such distinction and consequence that Augustus
thought of giving him his daughter Julia to wile. He was praised

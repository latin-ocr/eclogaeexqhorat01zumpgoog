Q. flousun rusum

Non Liberaeque, non acuta
Si geminant Corybantes aem,

Tristes ut irae, quas neque Noricus
Deterret ensis nec mare naufragum, to
Nec saevus ignis nec tremendo ,

Ju iter ipse ruens tumultu.

fertur Prometheus, addere principi
Limo coactus particulam undique
Desectam, et insani leonis
Vim stomacho apposuisse nostro.

Irae Thyesten exitio gravi
Strsvere et altis urbibus ultimae
Stetere causae, conperirent
Funditus imprimeretque muris

Hostile aratrum exercitus insolens.
Compesce mentem: me quoque pectoris
Tentavit in dulci juventa
Fervor et in celeres 'iambos

wss forced to edd something to thet which he had at first taken to
mehe men (called by Horace. princeps limus, ‘original clay.') He
therefore cut some clay from the unimals previously formed (uu-
dique,· that is, eu omnihus animalibus desecuit), arrd hence comes
the odd mixture of qualities in the human character. The poet
observes particularly that Prometheos took a piece of oley from the
lion: hence the oholer or tendency to unger in man. This ides of
the origin of meu and his passione is often taken up by the Greek

poete-17. Tlpesteu. 'l'he story of the qosrrel between Thyestes

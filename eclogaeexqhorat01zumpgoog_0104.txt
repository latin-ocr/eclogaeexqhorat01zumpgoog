An Ia. nonnum.

Au exhortation to L. Licinius Varro Murena to guard against
extremes. Prosperity and adversity have their turn iu the life
cl* almost every man. Licinius needed this advice, aud would
have been more happy and fortunate hudhe followed it. Ha
displayed towards all a caudour aud opeuuess of speech which

conspiracy against the life of Augustus was discovered, iu which

Raerrus vives, Licini, neque altum
Semper urgendo neque, dum procellae
Cautus horrescis, nimium premendo
Litus iniquum.

Deciduut turres feriuntque summos
Fulgura montes.

Alteram sortem bene praeparatum
Pectus. Inlormes hiemes reducit 15

llonarna tempestas coelum contraxit, et imbres
Nivesque deducunt lovem, nunc mare nunc silvae
Threicio aquilone sonant: rapiamus amice

Occasionem de die, dumque virent genua

Et decet, obducto solvatur fronte senectus. 5

Cetera mitte loqui: deus haec sortasse benigna

Reducet in sedem vice N unc et Achaemenio

Perfundi nardo juvat et fids Cyllenea

Levare diris pectora sollicitudinibus, 10
Nobilis ut grandi cecinit Centaurus alumno:

luvicte mortalis dea nate puer Thetide,

Te manet Assaraci tellus, quam frigide per-vt

Findunt Scamandri flumina lubricus et Simois,

lmhelli cithara carmina divides5
Nequicquam thalamo graves
Hastae et calami spicula Cnosii
Vitabis strepitumque et celerem sequi
Ajacem. Tamen heu serus adulteros
Cultus ulverecollines.
Non haertiaden, exitium tuae
Genti, non Pylium Nestora respiciet
Urgent impavidi te Salaminius
Teucer, te Sthenelus sciens ·
Pugnae, sive opus est imperitare equis, 25
Non auriga piger. Merionen quoque

Tydides melior patre,
Quem tu, cervus uti vallis in altera
Visum parte lupum graminis immemor,
Sublimi fugies mollia anhelitu,
Non hoc llicitus tuae.
lracun a diem proferet llio
Matronisque Phrygum classis Achillei 3 ·

not unsuccessfully. Horace, as it appears, became the chief lite·
rary assistant of Maecenas: he gave him information aboutnew “
baolrs, helped him in his own compositione, and wrote poems for

¹ bis gratification and amusement. A great part of the Satires, for

instance, was undoubtedly intended p'rimarily for Maecenas and
the intellectualcircle that he had drawn around him. Horace
acted also as his secretary in such state affairs as he had to attend
ιο. This is apparent from the sixtb Satira of tbe second book,
where a person requests Horace ιο obtain the signatura cs Mae·
cenas to a paper, asking his assistance quita in the style in which
one addresses the secretary of a great man. Inone passage, also,
Horace complains that the amount of business which he has to go
through at Rome prevents him from haring any leisurc. The
favour of Maecenas scon obtained sor our poet the means of mah·
ing n sufficient livelihocd: he became a scriba. Thisbe himself
indicates in sarii. 6, 365 and his biographer Suetonius says,
scriptum quaestoriam comparavit—‘he bought for himself a clerlr·
. ship ιο the quaestam! These scribae formed by no means an
uninfluential class in Rome. They were the under-secretaries in
all the government departments, an'd tb'e affairs of the-state were
in a great measure managed hy them. The chief secretaries were
changed annually, and consequently could be but very imper·
fectly acquainted with the duties os their office, which therefore
devolved necessarily on the scidae, they holding their posts sor
life. The state required from the raibce security for good con-

contrived to unite his new dnties with his employrnents at tbe
house of Maecenas, we can only form conjectures. Eitber be was
allowed to perform the duties of scriba by proxy, or he performed
them at the house (tf-Maecenas, since the latter, being osten
engaged in state affairs, could not dispense with the attendance
of his secretary. This, however, is certain-that Horace gradu·

ιο follow his poetical inclinatione undisturbed.

Αι first, perhaps, Horace lived in the house of Maecenas, and
was treated as a dependant; but as· tbe latter became more
acquainted with the poet’s merite, he gave him greater freedom
and independence. Let ns now imagine to ourselves Horace’s
condition and modeof spending his time. He has his own house
in town, with three servants to wait upon him. He bas his own
particular friends and associates, but be goes, perhaps daily, at a
certain honr, to the house ol Maecenas on the Esquiline Hill;
and to a special invitation from his patron even a promise made
ιο another must give way. Out of Rome, Horace possessas a

osattmtttt LIB. IV.

GARMEN 1x.

At> LOLLIUM.

Tuts odo is addressed to Μ. Lollius, consul in 21 rr. o., a man who
atone lime possessed iu a high degree the confidenoe of Augus-
tus, but lost it by his iugratitudd and insatiable avarice. In the
first part of this ode Horace treats os u subject similar to that of
the preceding3 namely, the power of pects to confer immortality:
iu the second part he praises Lollius, saying much—perhaps not
without special designa-of temporanee and inaccessibility ta ,
bribes.

Nasone credas interitura, quae

Longe sonantem natus ad Aufidum

Non ante vulgatas per artes

Verba loquor socianda chordis:
Non, si priores Maeonius tenet

Sedes Homerus, Pindaricae latent

Ceae ue et Alcaei minaces

Stesic orique graves Camenae3
Nec, si quid olim lusit Anacreon,

Delevit aetas 3 spirat adhue amor

Vivuntque commissi calores

- Aeoliae fidibus puellae.

1. Ne sorte credor. The spodosis begins with line 5.-2. Ad
longe sonantem Aufidum. See iii. 30, 10.-3. Non oute vulgatos
per artes ,· namely, lyric poetry. See iii. 30, 13.Ἰ This ors is more
particularly defined, as serlo sociande chordis, ‘words to be con·
nected with the strings,' songs which ure intended and ought to be
sung to the lyre. —5. Priores sedes. lle might also hove said pri·
mos sedes, but, strictl speaking, thore is only a comparison ho·
tween two parties- omer on the one side, and all other poets on
tha other: hence thexoompsrative. Homer is called lllueonr'ns, srom
lllaeon, which was said to be the nome ol his lothen—6. Pindari·
soe- Camettamf the, poenis of Pindar r’ see iv. 2, l. Ceae refers to
the poeuis of Simonides, a renowned elegist, who wos a native os
tho island ol Ceos. The songs of Alcaeus ure called minaces, he·
cause they were partly war-songs, partly calls to expel the tyrants
Pittacus and Myrsilus srom Lesbos. Stesichorus, too, wrote war·

which 'light kind of pdetry lusit is properly used. - 10. Spirotg, tised
figuratively, us tn thenext line uiuunt-ll. Construe thus: colores
Aeoliae praellae commissi sedibus. This construction seems bellet

CARMEN XXXIV.

A eourwrrnr remarkable poem, in which Horace shows the insui: ·
liciency of philosophy to supply in meu the place of a religione
saith. Horace was a follower of Epicurus, who held that the
gods exercised no superintendencc over human affairs, but that
chance regulated all things. A prodigy-namely, thunder in a
clear sky—hed aetonisbed and frigbtcned the poet: he makes
his observatione on this, aud comes to the conclusion that tlte

gods do rule tho world. ‚

Pisces deorum cultor et infrequens

Insanientis dum sapientiae

Consultus erro, nunc retrorsum

Vela dare atque iterare cursus

- Cogor relictos. Namque Diespiter,

lgni corusco nubila dividens

Plerumque, per purum tonantes

Egit equos volucremque currum,
Quo brute tellus et vage flumina,

Silvae laborantes, geluque
Flumina constiterint acutol
Dissolve frigus ligna super loco
Larga reponens atque benignius

Stravere ventos aequore fervido
Deproeliantes‚ nec cupressi
Nec veteres agitantur orni.

Sperne puer neque tu choreae,
Donec virenti canities abest
Morosa. Nunc et campus et arose
Lenesque sub noctem susurri .

tranquillity of Athens, and attended closely ιο his studies. He
attempted also the composition of Greek verses, but gave it up,
seeing that in Greek poetry no laurels were now ιο be won,
whereas the Latin literature of his time had bnt few great poeta
to point ιο. (Sul. i. 10, 31.) His quiet was brclren in upon by

the civil war3 ol which the republican party, under Brutus and
Cassius, transferred the seat to Greece. Ycung Horace was
enthusiaetic for liberty,'whcse representative Brutus was consi·
dered to be. He therefore joined the republican army asa volun·
teer, and was soon advanced by Brutus to the rank of tribunus
militam. This was a high honour for the son of a freedman to
obtain, especially one who had no great fortune3 consequently
enricus enemies were not wanting, but still he was able to main·
taiu bis position. He seems to have visited Asia Minor with
Brutus-at least if he was an eye-witness of the occurrence
which he describes in aar. i. 7. ln 42 a. c, however,he returned
to Graece, and took part in the battle of Philippi. Alter this
battle—in which the republicnns were defeated, andthe leaders
fell by their own hands-the greater part of the troops entered
the service of the triumviro, the officere were dismissed, and only
a few continued the war under Sex. Pompeius and Domitius
Ahenobarbus. Horace, in Odes, ir. 7, 9, describes himself as
haring been among the fugitives, saying that be had leh his
shield on the field cf battle. As soon astho state of politica
permitted, he returned to Italy, and went to Rome, where alone
he could hope tc riso by his abilities.

His patrimonia! estate, which had never been large, had during
the civil war been quite lost (Epist. ii. 2, 50), not by the proscrip-
tions, by which the triumvirs had attempted tc alter the condition
os Italy-scr Horace was too humble ιο be affected by them-
but by the general calamities of the country. The triumvirs had
to reward the soldiers who had assisted them against the repub·
lican party, and this could be done only by granting them small
estates. In the most flcurishingcities of Ilaly the owners of land
were obliged to give up their property tc the soldiers. Compen-
sation in money was promised indeed, but could not be given at
once, because the state treasury had been too thoroughly drained
during the constant wars cf the period; and it is very doubtful
whether full paymentwnsever made. Octavianus settled a colony
of reterens at Venusia, aud Horace's estate wasone of those
assigned to them. How washe now to live‘l Thebloodyand deso·

secured peace forr a while, produced a reaction: people began
to rejoice in peace, and feel a longing aster its erte. But elo-

Quiane repostum Caecubum-ad festas dapes
Victore laetus Caesare

Tecum subalta, sic Jovi gratum, domo,
Beate Maecenas, bibam,

Sonante mixtum tibiis carmen lyra,

Hac Dorium, illis barbaruml

Ut nuper, actus cum freto Neptunius

Dux fugit ustis navibus,

Minatus urbi vincla quae detraxerat

Servis amicus perfidis.

Romanuseheu, posteri negabitis,

Emanci lasseminae

Fert val um et arma miles et spadonibus
Servire- rugosis potest, .

interque signa turpe militana , 15
Sol adspicit conopium.

limited to a very recent period. Pompeius had strengthened the
crews of his vessels b taking in runaway slaves. -11.=Ant0ny de-
graded thelRoman sofdicrs still more, by making them serve Cleo·
patra. Thra reproach on Antony is founded on the fact that hs
married Cleopatra, aud wished her to be acknowledged and honoured
by hia Roman friends and soldiers as his lawful wife-ld. Cono-

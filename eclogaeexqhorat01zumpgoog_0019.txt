INTRODUOTION.

the most celebrated lyric poet
of the Romans, and who in all
κ ages, and among all natione
’· *a which have felt an interest in

⁴ poetry and intellectual culture,
has been greatly admired and
‚- Ξ Ι much imitated, was bomin the
·“ ““-““ J year 65 n.c., in the consulship
’,Ἅι ’ of L. Manlius Torquatus and
,ἶ J 2' ·· L. Aurelius Cotta. Hence in
' Ἰ odes, iii. 21, he addresses to an
Ἴ ” amphora the words Ο nata
mecum consule Manlio; and in
Epist. i.·20, he mentions thatin
the December of 21 a. c., he had completed his forty·fourth
year. December was therefore his birth-month; and we learn
from a short notice of Horace’s life, which probably formed a
chapter in Suetonius’ Lives of the Roman Poets, that the day
was the 8th of the month (α. d. vi. Id. Dec.) Horace was conse-
quently six years younger than Livy, five years younger than virgil,
and two years older than Augustus. His native place was
Venusia, an ancient Latin colony, which, at the time of the
Social War, 91 a. c., had received the full Roman franchise,
antl was consequentlya municipium. Venusia wa‘s in Apulia,
but just on the confines of Lucania-5 in which, indeed, a part
of the territory belonging to it in later times was situated.
Hence Horace, in Sat. ii. 1, 34, in speaking of himself, jokingly
says, Lucanus cm Appulus anceps. His father belonged to the
lowest class of freemen: he was a freedman (libertinus), which
indicates that he had formerly been a slave3 and had, upon
his manumission, assumed the name of his master—Horatius.
Whether he had a cognomen or not, is unknown. That of
Flaccus, which his son bore, was properly given to persons with

long loose ears. -

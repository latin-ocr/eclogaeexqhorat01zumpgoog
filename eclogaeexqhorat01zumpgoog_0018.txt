and aller him many learned men directed their attention to the
explanation os Horace's languaga and allusione, till the time os
Richard Bentley, whose first edition was published at Cambridge
in 1711. Bentley, by this edition, established hia farne as a
decided genius in criticisnr. He altered the text oi Horace in
about eight hundred passages, osten according to the readings οἱ
= manuscripts (sor he had many, and some were excellent), oiten
also, however, upon simple conjecture. More modern critice
have perceived that manyosBentley’s corrections were not what
the poet wrote, but merely what he might have written. But
even in his unsuccesssul emendations, he has afforded to later
critica and commentators rich and interesting materiale for de·
bate, from which none hasbeen able to escape. In the present
edition, considering that it is intended chiefly for schools, we
have seldom mentioned Bentley's name, bnt in many cases we
have been unable to resrain sroru touching, generally in a very
sew words, upon points about which lie has raised controver-
sias. The direction that the criticism on Horace has taken since
Bentley's time is the poeticoeesthetic‚ the character os which is
best developed in Mitscherlioh's somewhat diffuse, but yet erudite
andjudicious edition of the Odes (Leipzig, 1800.) Veryrecently,
Jo. Casp. Orelli-whose third edition has appeared in the year
rano-has endeavoured to combine the explanatory and aesthetic
style os commentary witha new critical recension. We have
taken his text as the basis of curs, paying careful regard, how·
ever, both to former editions os all Horace's works, aud also to
the numerous editions cs datached portione οῖ’ them; among
which L. F. Heindorihs edition os the Satires (Second, Leipzig,
1843) deserves particular notice.

The present edition contains nearly all the poema os Horace,
those only having been excluded which cannot be made use oi
sor educational purposes. Tha commentary was begnn by Pro

sessor C. G. Zumpt. He died, however, without completing more ,

than the notes on the Epodes. The remainder the undersigned
has endeavoured to executa in his father's spirit.

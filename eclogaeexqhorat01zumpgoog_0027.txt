tinned his activity till he had attained a considerable age. Hs
intended ιο conclude his poetical exertions with the first book of
the Epistles, which he published in the year 20 ι. c., when hs
. was in his sowy-fifth year. However, he still occasionally made
poema (particularly odes, iv. 14) in celebration of exploits of
members of the reigning family3 and at last, long atter the pub·
lication of the first three books cf Orias, he issued a fourth ; and
besides, by the wish of Angustus, wrote the second bools cf
Epistles. lt is thus certain that Horace himself published his
poems divided into boohs; and in regard to the Ars Portica alone,
it is a possible, bnt not a probable supposition‚ that it was issued
after its author's death. It seems likely, therefore, that all of
Horace’s poetry which hc himself considered worthy of publi·
oetion, has come down ro us.

Horace commenced his poetica! labours in his youth with sati·
rical poetry‚ which with him assumed two forms-the satire pro-
perly so called, and themora lyrical epode. ln the Satires, we

, find no allusion ιο the battle of Actium, or ιο the events imme-

diately preceding; theywere therefore finished‚ and perhaps also
publiehed before 32 a. c. It appears, moreover, that· the two beclas
were issued together. They were compcsed cn various mna·
sione, partly for the amusement cf Maecenas's socialcirclc; arrd
appear to have been intended originally entirely for the enter·
tainment cf private friends. Horace read each separately ιο his
friends, aa he compcsed them ς alterwards he divided them into
books, and published them. They were followed by the book
of Epodes. Some os these Epodes were undoubtedly compcsed
long before; bnt we find in the bools allusione to the impending
hattle between Antony and Octavianus, which held all Italy in
trembling anxiety, and also a lind of triumpha} song on the
victory at Actium 5 so that the book seems tc have been published
immediately after it. With the Epodes, Horace closed his satirical
poetry. He had gained a name by it, buthad also madehimself
enemies ; and in h'is riper years he acknowledge'd that it was not
enough scr a person ιο mark' end satirise the faults' of his follows,
but that he must himself attemptto'pryduce something excellent.
He brought the hexameter of thcAEatires to perfectiori in the
Epistles, and changed the simple iarnbic verse of the Epodes sor
the strict and artistic matres of the Odes. He finished the first
three books of the Odes about the year 20 s. ο,, and published
them together, as appears from the first Ode, and from tha last
of the third bools. The ilrst book ef the Epistles was also issued
in the year 20 a. c.; and with it, as we have already observed,
Horace intended to close his poeticul career, But in 1⁷ a. c, at

the emperor's requeti, he wrote the Carmen Susmlcre5 and soon
afterwards-at all events before 13 a. c.-hs published the fourth

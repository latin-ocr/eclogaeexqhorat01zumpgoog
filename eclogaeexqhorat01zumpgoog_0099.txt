company cf some noble Roman, to set out for Spain, where in
the years 27 and 26 1. 0., a ficrce war ‘was carried ou with the
tribe 01 the Cantabri. He declares that he is wearied 01 an
unsettled life and of campaiguing3 and he wishes, as tbe abode
of his old age, either his house in Tibur or one in Tarentum.

Sit meae sedes utinam senectae,

Rura Phalanto.

Ille terrarum mihi praeter omnes
Angelus ridet, ubi non Hymetto

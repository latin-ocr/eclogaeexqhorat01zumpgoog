Q. HORATII FLACCI

lllum aget penna metuente solvi
Fama superstes.

Latius regnes aridum domando

Dissidens plebi numero beatorum '
Eximit virtus populumque falsis
Dedocetuti . 20

Vocibus3 regnum et diadema tutum
Delerens uni propriamque laurum,

he were lord of Spain and Africa- 13. Comparison of avarice with

thirst (this should, properly, be said of the sufl'erer, not of the dia·
easet-so aleo avariae, the more ir has, tbe more it would have.
Nothing but the conviction that virtue alone is able to make a man
happy carr eradicata this viee-17. Phraaten. Phraates lv. king
of the Parthians, whom his subjecte had expelled sor his cruelty‚
had recently (26 a. o.) been reinstated in his power by the help of

wise and virtuous man, bein of a different opinion from the mass
of the eople, who re ard rastas as happy because he hasbeen
restored to his king om, numero beatorum eximit, ‘excepts him
from the number ol the happy,' does not consider him as really
happy. Observa, in the seanuing of this line, that the am of beato·

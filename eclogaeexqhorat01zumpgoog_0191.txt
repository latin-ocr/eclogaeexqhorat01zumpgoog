OARMEN SAEGULARE.

In the year 17 a. 0. Augustus celebrated the ludi maculares. Thess
were instituted in the earliest times 01 Rome, 10 mark with
solemnity the longest period 1ο which human life was supposed
ever to extend: but it was a disputed point whether saeculum in
regard to these gemes meant, 11 111 common usage, 1 space 01
100, 01, in a peculiar religione sense, 110 years. Both views
found supporters. Augustus, aster the pacification of the ern-
pire, wishing to reawalren the religious ¹seeling 01 the people,
which during the long civil wars had almost died away, re-
solved to rerive these gemes, which, as Suetonius (August. 31)
tells us, had fallen into disuse. He ordered the Sibylline books
to be consulted; and these, taking the cycle 01 110 years, stated
the year and the mode 01 celebratiug the festival. The next
who celebrated these gamea was the Emperor Claudius, 1. u. 47
(1.1. 0. 800), following the cyclo 01 100 ycars; 01011 1. n. 88
(10.0. 841), Domitian, and 10. 204 (1.1, 0. 957), Septimius
Severus, again following the rechoning of Augustum and lastly,
aa. 247 (s. 110. 1000), Philippus. The secular gemes lasted
101 three days, beginning in the eveniug andcontinuing during
the night They consisted in the offcring 0111110111 1101111001 10
111 the gods 01 Rome (hence, in line 1011011111 septem pla-
cuere colles), and are full described by Zosimus, ii. 5.

To heighten the interest oy the festival, Augustus requested from
Horace 1 cannen saeculare, which wasto be sung by a choir 01
boys and girls. Many commentatore have been of opinion that
the song is a so-called cannenumoebueum5 thetis, consiste 01
stamas intended 10 be sung alternately by the boys and girls.
But this opinion finds no confirmation in the poem itself, equally
little ia the description which we have of the proceedings at the
garnes, and 11 altogether improbable. In the aeathetie criticism
01 thepoem, we must remember that it was an official composi-
tion, in which no high llight 01 poetic fancy could be allowed.
11 11 addressed 10 Apollo and Diana, to whom the Sibyllino books
directed a poem as well as 1 sacrifice tc be offered.

and 10 Diana, who was goddess 01 the moon as well 1101 the

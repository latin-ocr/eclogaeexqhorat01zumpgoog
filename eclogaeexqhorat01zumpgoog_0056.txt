Tu na quaesieris (scire naias), quem mibi, quern tibi

Finem di dederint, Leuconoe, neo Babylonios
Tentaris numeros. Ut melius, quidquid erit, pati!
Seu plures hiemes seu tribuit Jupiter ultimam,

Quae nuno oppositis debilitat pumicibus mare li
Tyrrhenum, sapias, vina liques et apatio brevi
Spem longam reseces. Dum loquimur, sugerit invida
Aetas: carpe diem, quarn minimum credula postero.

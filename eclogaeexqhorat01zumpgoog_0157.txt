esurimus! mu. 111.

Velox mente noval quibus
Antris egregii Caesaris audiar
Aeternum meditans decus
Stellis inserere et concilio Josisl
Dicam insigne recens adhuc
indictum ore alio. Nou secus in jugis
Exsomnis stupet Evias,
Hebrum prospiciens et nive candidam
Thracen ac pede barbaro
Lustratam Rhodopen, ut mihi devio
Ripae et vacuum neruus
Mirari libet. ONaiadum potens
Baccharumque, valentium
proceras manibus vertere fraxinos,
Nil parvum aut humili modo,
Nil mortale loquar. Dulce periculum est,
0 Lenaee, sequi deum
cingentem viridi tempora pampino. 20

Houor makes his friend and brother poet Fundanius (see i. 10,
42) describe a feast which Nasidienus Rufius, a man who with
debauchery combined a certain degree of avarica, had giren to
Maecenas and his train. The couches, as we sea from line 20
and following, were thus arranged :—

(1) Fundanius; (2) Viscus; (3) Varius; (4) Servilius, (5)
Maecenau (6) Vibidius; (Ἰ) Nomentanus, (8) Nasidienus;
εἰ) Porcius. It is worthy ot' remark, that the arrangements of
t table correspond with the tules which Horace lays down in
the 4th satire ot'- this book. Perhaps, therefore, in that satire
Nasidienus is to be looked upon aa the inrent'or of the precepta.

‘Ur Nasidieni juvit te coena beati'l

Natu mihi, convivam quaerenti, dictus here illio

'De rnedio potare die! (δίο, ut mihi nunquam

ln vita luerit melius.' ‘Dio, si grave non est, ’

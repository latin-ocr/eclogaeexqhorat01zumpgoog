GARMINUM nm. Π.

Obliviones. Est animus tibi
Rerumque prudens et secundis
Temporibus dubiisque rectus,

Vindex avarae fraudis et abstinens
Ducentis ad se cuncta pecuniae,
Consulque, non unius anni,

Sed quoties bonus atque fidus

,ludex honesturn praetulit utili,

, Rejecit alto dona nocentium
Vultu, et per obstantes catervas
Explicuit sua victor arma.

Non possidentem multa vocaveris
Recte beatum 3 rectius occupat
Nomen beati, qui deornm
Muneribus sapienter uti

Duramque callet pauperiem pati,
Peju ue leto flagitium timet, ·
Non il e pro caris amicis
Aut patria timidus perire. “

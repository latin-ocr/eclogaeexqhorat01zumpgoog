Hoc caverat mens provida Reguli,
Dissentientis condicionibus
Foedis et exemplo trahentis
Perniciem veniens in aevum,
Si non periret immiserabilis

Affixs delubris et arrae
Militibus sine caede‚' dixit,

Retorta tergo brachia libero
Portasque non clauses et arva
Marte ooli populate nostro. '
Auro repensus scilicet acrior
Miles redibit. Flagitio additis
Damnum: neque amissos colores
Lena refert medioata fuco,
Neo vera virtus, curn semel excidit,
Curat reponi deterioribus. 30

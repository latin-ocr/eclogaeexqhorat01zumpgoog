CARMIHUM LIB. IV.

Romana pubes crevit, et impio
Vastata Poenorum tumultu
Fana deos habuere rectos, ⁸

Dixitque tandem perfidus Hannibal:
‘Cervi‚ luporum praeda rapacium,
Sectamur ultro, quos opimus
Fallere et effugere est triumphus. .

' Gens, quae cremato sartis ab llio

Natosque maturosque patres
Pertulit Ausonias ad urbes,

Duris ut ilex tonsa bipennibus
Nigrae feraci frondis in Algido,

Per damna, per caedes ab ipso ,
Ducit opes animumque ferro.

Non Hydra secto corpore firmior '
Vinci dolentem crevit in Herculem
Monstrumve summisere Colchi
Majus Echioniaeue Thebae.

AD 0. VALGIUM.

Tuis poem, the composition of which seems to fall iu the year
20 rac„ is addressed to C. Valgius Rufus, a friend ot' Horace.
and a rnen distinguished as a statesman (for he was consul sos-
seetus in 12 no), and also as e writer both of prose and poetry.
Valgius grievcd insmoderately et the death of a young friend
called Mystes, and devoted his poetical talento to the sole pur-
pose of bewailing his loss. Horace urges hirn to turn his atten-
tion to more serious and worthy subjecte, particularly the praises
of Augustus, and the recent exploits of the Romm people.

Et-foliis viduantur orni:
Tu semper urges flebilibus modis

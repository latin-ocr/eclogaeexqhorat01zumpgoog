AD POPULUM ROMANUM.

&rur ct' fancy. 'Phe poet calle upon the Romans to emigrata
horn Italy, where civil war is constantly breaking out anew, to

the islanda ot' the blest. These islanda on the west coast ot* .-

Africa, now the Canaries, were sarned throughout all untiquity
for their salubrioue climate, their existence and nature, however,
being treated more as poetioal fancies than realitiea Even the
most ancient Greeks had an undeflned and vague knowledge of
thern, and the poete described thern as the happy abode of the
spirits os mea. ‘ltro Roman general, Sertorius, having found
himself unable to make head ln Spain against Pompey, intended

aettlements, or of the foundation cf any towns on tbenr hythe
Rornans, there is no record. Theneglect of the Romans, to dis-

, cover and make use of the islanda on the African coast is sur-

was still land enough, thinly peopled, on the continent of Europe,

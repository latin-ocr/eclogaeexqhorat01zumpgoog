No ancient writer has been so thoroughly subjected to nil kinds
os criticism as Horace. The number ol those who, in ancient
and modern times, have published editions os his whole worlrs‚
or oi detachcd porticus, is so great, that the mere enumeratiou
ol them would require u volume. We might suppose at first
glance that all the aids which can be desired in regard to an
ancient author-grammarians, manuscripts, and commentatore-
exist in rich abundance sor Horace; and yet, upon a closer
examination‚ we find that much still remains to be done. Two
ancient grammaticus havc' leli commentaries on floraco-namen,
Helonius Acron and Pomponius Porphyrion. They lived towards
the· close of the finh century aster Christ3 but their scholia, as
they have come down tous, are to a great extent mixed up with
later commento. Resides these, Jacob Cruquius, in his edition
(Antwerp, 1578), has madanp an ancient commentary from tho
marginal notes of four Codices Blandiniuni, so called from the
Blandin monastery on the Blandin Hill, in Ghent. These ancient
scholia nra not so good as those which we possess on some other
writers3 but they are nseiul on account of the interesting and
valnable information which they contain regardingpersons men·
tioned by Horace, particularly iu the Satires, and which these
commentators had extractcd lrom earlier boolrs dc personis Horu·
tiortt's. Consequently, in every edition os the poet they must be
mentioned and made use os.

Theronis more than two hundred manuscripts ol Horace in
existence, some os them very good. Tha above-mentioned Blan-
dt'm'ani, made use os by Cruquius‚ were particularly excellent,
butaro now lost. Only a saw os the others have been thoronghly
colleted3 and it is mutter ol astonishment that, notwithstand-
ing the number ol editions, a text os the Horatian poema really
founded on the manuscripts, and critically amended, is stilla
desideratum. The first who published an edition os Horace with
a commentary was christophorus Landinus (Florence‚ 1482);

X INTRODUG'HON.

small estate-either a direct present srom Maecenas, or obtained
by his influente, as compensation for the patrimonial property
which had been assigned to the veterans. This estate is the pride
and joy os the poet's beart: berche seels bappyin rural seclusion
and simplicity; and bitbor he invites (repeatedly in his Odes)
his particular friends, if they wish to enjoy country lise. He is in
Rome only during the tima when be nrust be there-namely, tbe
beginning os the year. He returns to his Sabine sarm assoon as
ba possibly can, and lives there sor tho remainder astho year;
except when he goes, aa tbc state oi his health osten obliges him
to do, to the warin baths os Baiae, or ιο the sea-bathing at aomo
town in southern Italy.

The situation and appearance os this celebrated sarm may be
pretty well determincd from the notices which he gives in Epist.
i. 14, 16, and 18; and Sat. ii. 6. We crosa over to the right bank
of the Anio at Tibur (the modern Tivoli), and then go up along
the river, following the oia Valetiaas sar as the little village os
Varia (now Vicovaro.) This village lies to the lestos the public
road, on a bill above the Anio, eight Roman miles stom Tibur.
Horace's estate was in the district connected with this village3 '
and had, in earlier times, when landad property in Italy was
distributed among more persons, sufficed for the supportes five
familias: now it was cultivated sor Horace by eight slaves. It
was situated in a valley, which lay in thedirection from north to

able rivulet, called the Digentia (now Licenza), flows through
the middle of the valley, falling into the Anio abouta mile above
Varia. Thus sartha locality is certain, andcan etpreseuteasily
be sound3 but the exact place where the villa stoodit is scarcely
possible to iix, since it was certainly not so magnificent or lasting
that traces of it should remain till now. Horace, in Odesiii. 13,
mentions a sons Bandusiae as springing up near his sarm. Is this
was the largest os the numerous broolrs which bubblo up on the
slope os the bill on the right sida of the Digentia, then the villa
must have been situated some three miles up the valley. There
was connected with this house in the country a house in Tibur,
according to a custom which still holds in the smaller towns os
Italy, that to each house a certain piace oi land belongs, on which
again may he a villa. The poet, therefore, osten praises Tibur as
his derling residence, where ,the Muses favoured him most, and
where he wished that he might romain in his old age. Suetonius,
in his biography os Horace, says, Vicit plurimam in secant ruris
eni Sabini aui Tiburtini: dominatuque ostenditur eirca Tiburni
luculum. Now the grove of Tiburnus, anold local god os Tibur,
must have been in, or at least very near, the town. For these

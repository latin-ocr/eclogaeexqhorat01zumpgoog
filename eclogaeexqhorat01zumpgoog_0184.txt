A mrm invitation addreseed to Virgil. He is tc bring with him
a box cf ointmcnt, whilst Horace will supply a pitcher os wine.
Whether the poet Vrrgil be meent, to whom the third ode of the
first hook resen, or some other Virgilius to us unknown, we have
nc means of amemining. 1r we believe the poet to be meant,
then we must suppose the ode to have bean written earlier than
the others in this book, for Virgil died ia 19 a. c. Aa to the date
of tbe publication ci this book, aee tha introduction. “

Jaaa veris comites, quae mare temperant,
impellunt animae lintea Thracia05
Jam nec prata rigent, nec fluvii strepunt
Hiberna nive turgidi:
N idum ponit ltyn flebiliter gemens 5
Infelix avis et Cecropiae domus
Aeternum opprobrium, quod mele barbarae
Regum est u ta libidines. ,
Dicunt in tenero gramine pinguium
Custodes ovium carmina fistula, 10
Delectantque deum, cui pecus et nigri
Colles Arcadiae placent.

1. Temptarunt: tranqudloot, ‘quiea reduce to a slight motion ς’
hence they impellant linteo. Thracian (here used sor ‘northerly,’)

Hiberna nive. This must be understood as comprehending rain as
well as snow.7·b. Nudum ponit, etc. The sense is: already is the
swallow buildrng her nest, a s' n of opening s ring. Compare
Epist. i. 7, 13. ,The story to w ich the poet allodes os Procne,
daughter of Pandron, king of Attica, and sister oi Philomela, who,
being inflamed by jaalousy against her husband Tereus, king of
Thrace, slew her son Itys, and put him down et table before his
lathem and who when tereus, in his indi nation, attempted to kill
her, was changed into a swallow, whilst Philomela became ani bt-
rngale, rs well known. Cecropia domita in linc 6 is the house olg the

kin sol Attica, of whom Cecro s was the first. To it the atrocious
dead oi Procne was an eternal disgrace. Other kings as well aa

Tereus are devoted to the gratification os their passiones hence the
plural regum, giving libidines a more general reserenca3 confined,
owever, to barbariam (for the Thraciam were barbariam.)-9.
Dicunt = cauum-11. Deum: namely, Pan, who invented the
shepherd's ipe, and whose worship came lrom Arcadia-12. Colles
Arcadiae, senalus, Lycaeus, Cyllene, which are called a· ri,

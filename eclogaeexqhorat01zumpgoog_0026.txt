why, towards the end of his life, his visits to Rome becamefewer
and fewer. But, upon the whole, the connection between the two
friends remeined the same; and ought always to he considered
as a patrem for the relations between an artist or poet and his
patron. The meretha farne of Horace increased, the more inti·
mate became his friendship with Maecenas. No petty jealousy
interfered with their mutual affection and respect Good for-
tune preserved the friends from the necessity of a separation,
and gratified the wish of Horace not to survive Maecenas long.
Maecenas died, after a protracted illness, in the year 8 a. c.; and
when near liis end, hs commended our poet to Augustus in the
following words: Horatii Flacci, ut ιιιιί, maner esto. Horace fol·
lowed soon after, on the 2'lth of November in the same year,
having very nearly completed his fifty-seventh year. Death toolr
him hy surprise: he had not time td mehe a will, hut, having
no children οτ relations, named orally Augustus as his heir. He
was buried near his long-loved friend Maecenas on theEsquiliue
Hill.

Horace frequently describes his own bodily appearance and
mental temperament. He was of small stature, and had dash
eyes and blaclr hair; though the latter, as he grew older, became
somewhat gray. ln his youth, he was of a wealrly constitution,
and suffered from a complaint in his eyes. When he reached
the age of manhood, his general health did not much improve,
buthe became stout and corpulent5 so that Augustus used to
johe with him upon his rotundity. ln temperament, he says, he
was hot, in his youth even passionate3 in his later years easily
irritated, hut easily calmed again. His dress was simple, and
rather careless than elegant. ln his mode of life he studied
comfort and ease, which never degenerated into luxury. ’

This, then, was the poet of whom Quintilian, the greatest cf
Roman critica, remarks, that he was almost the only Latin lyrist
who deserved to he read-a judgment which has been fully rati·
fied by posterity; sor scarcely any nation has ever had any lyric
poet who has heen so extensively read, admired, and imitated as
Horace. Itis therefore worth while to say something regarding
his poetry in general, and regarding the lriuds of poetry which
he cultivated.

¹ lt is of great importencs for the thorough comprehension and
enjoyment of a poet like Horace, whose excellence consiste in
his having invested the particular circumstances and friendships
which led him to write with a universal interest, that we should
know when his poema werecomposed3 and, even since Bentley
spolie hriefly, generally, and without stannig proofs, on this
question, it has been sagerly tehen up by every subsequentcom·

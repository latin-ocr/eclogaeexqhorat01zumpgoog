vindemiator et invictus, cui saepe viator

Cessisset, magna compellans voce cuculum.

At Graecus, postquam est ltalo perinsus aceto,

Persius exclamat: ‘per magnos, Brute, deos te

Oro, qui reges consueris tollere, cur non

Hunc 'liegem jugulas? operum hoc, mihi crede, tuorum
est. ' 35

-30, Vindemiotor is to be read as a word of four syllables, the
second being long; rhus, vinderetur. Compare Corn. iii. 4, 41.
-35. Operam lucc tuorum cst, ‘thie is a· part of thy business, is a
proceedrng suitable for thee.' Hence the wit lies in the name Rex,
which, as well as Regulus, occurs osten in Roman familias.

sacras x. 1

lu the tth satire of this book Horace had censured Lucilius, his
predecessor in satirical composition, attributing to him careless-
ness in regard to form -a matter essentiel in productione which
ara intended to cndure. In the reign of Augustus there arose
among the critice two parties, the one pnying unconditional
homage to the ancient Roman writers, whose vigour and talent
they admired; the other secking to create something new, and
insisting particularly upon strict attention to form, style, ond
versification. Under thc first emperors the latter party was pre-
dominant; but aster Hadrian¹s tirno tho former assumed swey,
and then began the rapid decline of Roman literature. In this
satire Horace maintains his opinion of Lucilius, and justifies his
own exertions. He rushes at once in merline res, by a referring
to his previous criticism‚ which is implied in the particle nempe.
This want of a prefnce displensed the old grammarians, who
therefore prefixed eight lines, which are here given, as they form
a kind ol* introduction. These lines are wanting in the oldest
end bcst manuscripts. This is the last satire os the first book,
and is intended to guide the render in his criticism of the whole

[Luonn² quam sis mendosus, teste Catone
Defensore tuo pervincam‚ qui male factos
Emendare parat versus, hoc lenius ille,
Est quo vir melior, longe subtilior illo
Qui multum puer et loris et funibus udis
Exhortatus, nt esset opem qui ferre poetis

external advantagee Horace was iadebted ιο the favour and
friendship os Maecenas: the literary friends whom he metat
his house encouraged him ιο poetical activity and ιο improve-
“ mantin the art, aud there,too, he became acquainted with many
men of power and influence in the state. It would have been
easy for him ιο alter his position iu regard ιο Maecenas, end ιο
atrike out for himself a path ιο honour arrd authority3 but how

little he thought ol this appears from his conduct ιο Augustus.
Maecenas had spoken of Horace ιο the emperor, and had given
him a copy of his poems; with which, being a man of taste, end
from disposition as well as from political motivas a patron cf
literature, he expreseed himself as deiighted. He wanted a
secretary to write letters for him, and asired Maecenas ιο give
up Horace ιο him. Maecenas consented3 but Horace pleaded
the wealr state of his health¹ tc escape taking the office, which
would have given him much influence, but at the same time
much trouble. Augustus admitted the excuse, and was not
angry; buthe wished thet Horace would spealr of his exploits
in his poema, or rather that he would writea poem upon them,
and ha felt hnrt that the poet had not mentioned himin any
previous productiori. But Horace declined ιο attempt any such
panegyric, his reason being either that which he gave—namely,
that lre had no talant for epic poetry-or, as is mere probahis,
that ha hated flattery. He had in his youth belonged ιο the
republican party3 arrd though in his matures years he felt and
acknowledged that the restoration of the republic was impossible,
and the government of Augustus beneficent, still he was unwill-
ing to act in such a manner as indirectly ιο depreciate the merite
of those heroes who had formerly been the gods of his idolatry.
But he often praised the administration cf Augustus, which had,
in trutb, induced contentment aud excited gratitudo in all-
extolling him=sor having given ιο Italy¹ and the Roman Empire
the long wished-sor blessings of peace3 for having, by successful
battles,extended arid eecured the boundaries of his dominions;
and for labouring most zcalously, by good institutione and wisc
laws, to elevate the moral condition cf the people. It was not
till aller pressing requests hom Augustus, which he could not
refuso without giving grem offense, that Horace resolved ιο cele·
brata in two odes the victories of Tiberius and Drusus, the step-
scns os the emperor, anri for this reason to add a fourth hcolr
of Odes ιο the three which were already in the hands of the
public. The epistle tc Augustus (Epist. ii. 1) was written on the
same occasion.

Maecenas, particularly when he grew old, and fell into bad
health, also made demands upon the poet which he could net
reconcile with his principles, and thie was probably the reason

Arguta meretrice potes Davoque Chremeta to
Eludente senem comes garrire libellos

Ut nemo, Varius ducit, molle atque lacerum ’
Virgilio annuerunt gaudentes rure Camenae. 45

' Atque quibusdam aliis, melius qnod scribere possem,
inventore minor, neque ego illi detrahere ausim
Haerentem capiti curn multa laude coronam.
At dixi fluere hunc lutulentum, saepe ferentem ⁵0
Plura quidem tollenda relinquendis. Age, quaeso,⁸
Tu nihil in magno doctus reprehendis Humeroi

' Nil cornis tragici mutat Lucilius Atti,
Non ridet versus Enni gravitate minores,
Quum de se loquitur, nen ur majore reprensisi 55
Quid vetat et nosmet Lucili scripta legentes
Quaerere, num illins, num rerum dura negarit
Versiculos natata magis iactos et euntes
Mallius, ac si quis pedibus quid claudere senis,
Hoc tantum contentus, amet scripsisse ducentos so
Ante cibum versus, totidem coenatus, Etrusci

by Ρ. Terentius Varro Atacinus, the most learned Roman of hir
time, and by others, but was still in need of improvement-50.
Horace hadx said of Lucilius in a previous satire (i. 4, 11), Quum
flueret lutulentas, erat qaod tollere celles,¹ that is, as his language
was by no means pare, thera was much which one would expungo.
This judgment he re ats here still more strongly: plara tollenda

Iu this ode Horace excuses himself scr not attempting that losty
kind of lyric poetry which Pindar had cultivated among the
Greeks, but contenting himself with imitating the lighter songs
of Alcaeus and Sappho. The poem is addressed to Mark
Antony's son, Iulus Antonius, who was brought up by Augustus
and his sister Octavia. At this time Antonius was held in
respect and honour ; so much so, indeed, that in the year 1ss
s. c.,he obtained the consulship. Alterwards, however, in 2 ac,
he was discovered to be implicated in a conspiracy against the
emperor, and wasvobliged to hill himself. The ode was written

shortly before 13 ac.

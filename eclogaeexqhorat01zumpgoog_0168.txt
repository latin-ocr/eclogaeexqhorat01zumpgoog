Ο mutis quoque piscibus

Totum muneris hoc tui est,
Quod monstror digito praetereuntium
Romanae fidicen lyrae:
Quod spiro et placeo, si placeo, tuum est.

DRUSI Lacuna.

Onu in praisc of Claudius Drusus Nero, the younger brother of tha
Emperor Tiberius, and stepson of Augustus. 'l'he two brothers
had, in the year 15 u. o.‚ carried on an arduous bnt successiirl
war against the Raetians and Vindelicirrns. Drusus, then a
{cuth of twenty-three, had become particularly dear to the

oman people; because they believed that, if he reached the
throne, he would restore the ancient freedom.

Horace, with great skill, so constructe his od'c us to give even
greater praise to Augustus than to Drusus3 for to the emperor's
training he attributes the young man's talenta and successes.

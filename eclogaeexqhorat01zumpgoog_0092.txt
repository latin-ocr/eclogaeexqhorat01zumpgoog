C. Aerurus Pcnnro, in whose praise this ode was written, was, both
from his high birth, and from his distinction in the political as
well as literary world, one of the leading men of bis time.
When but a youth he came promineutly forward as an oraton
for we find him in 75 nc.. in his twenty-third year, accueing C.
Cato. After thir he served under Caesam and during the civil
vvars aller Caesar's death, ho held an independent command.
In the year 43 ac. he deeided the fall of the republican party
by siding with Mark Antony, when defeated and a fugitive, and
bringing about the triumviratc of Octavianus, Antony‚ and
Lepidus. In the year 40 ac. he was consul, and received in
the following year the province of Illyricum. Whilst in this
command, he conquered the barbaroue tribes of the Parthini
aud Dalmatians, and took the town of Salonae. For these
victorias he, on the aad October 39 ac, celebrated a triumph,
which was called the Dalmatian. In the quarrela between
Octavianus and Antony he attempted, so long as it was possible,
to act as mediator, inclining, however, more to the party of the
latinu aud he could not be prevailed upon, even before tbe

old republican spirit, to serve under Octavianus. During the
time when these disputes and quarrels were going on, aud when
he could not be politically active, he turned his attention to
literature, and wrote trogodies and historical works; among the

latter, especially, a histor of the last civil ware, from the year

60 a. c. the consulship of h· Afranius and Q. Caecilius Metellus),

when what is called the first triumvirate was formed by Pompey,
Caesar, aud Crassus. It ir to be lamented‚ that of all Pollio's
writings nothing except the very smallest fragments has come

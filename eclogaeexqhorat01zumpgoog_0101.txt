Cum qua morantem saepe diem mero
Fregi coronatus nitentes
Melabathra Syrio capillos.

Tecum Philippos et celerem fugam
Sensi, relicta non bene parmula,

Cum fracta virtus et minaces
Turpe solum tetigere mento.

Sed mc per hostes Mercurius celer
Denso paventem sustulit aere3
Ta rursus in bellurn resorbens
Unda fretis tulit aestuosis.

Erga obligatam redde Jovt dapem,
Longaque fessum militia latus
Depone sub lauru mea, nec
Parce cadis tibi destinatis.

Oblivioso levia Massica
Cibaria exple, suade capacibus
Unguenta de conchis. Quis udo
Deproperare apio coronas

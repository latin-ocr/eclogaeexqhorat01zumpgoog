CARMBN V.

Art ode written in the year 20 s. c.. when Augustus, by threats of
war, compelled Phraates, king of the Parthians, to restore the
Roman standards, and ths large number of Roiumi prisoners that
had fallen into the hands of his nation in the unfortunate expe-
ditione of M. Crassus and M. Antonius. Some short time before

{lecta ot' his adoptive father Caesar, had threatened with war,
ad, nominally at least, submitted to the Roman power. See

Odes, i. 35, 30, and 21, 15. The joy in Rome ut both events
was great, and Horace expresses his in this ode. He begine
with a description of the disgracesul servitude of the Romans
among the Parthians, and then shows by the example ofliegulus,
that to ransom them would have been base and injurious. But
ns Augustus has by threate of war forced their restoration, hs
must he considered as a god. ¹ '

ΔΙ) umiiimuiu VARUM.

Tris praises ol' the vine, and an exhortation to moderate drinking.

Quintilius Varus, to whom the poem is addressed,is otherwise
. unknown: he is probably the same friend of virgil aud Horace
whose death is bewailed in the 2dth Ode.

Numani, Vere, sacra vite prius severis arborem
ciioa mite solum Tiburis et incenia Catili.
Siccis omnia narn dura deus inposuit, neque
Mordaces aliter diffugiunt soiiicitudines.

Quis post vina gravem militiam aut pauperiem orepatl 5
Quis non te potius, Bacche patei, teque decens Venusl
At, ne quis modici transiliat munera Liberi,

Centaurea monet cuin Lapithis rixa super mero

Debellata, monet Sithoniis non levis Euius,

Cuin las atque nasas exiguo tine libidinum 10
Discernunt avidi. Non ego te, candida bononien,
Invitum quatiam nec variis obsita frondibus

modelled 11111 was the first to bring it into general notice. This
kind 01 poetry was unknown to the Greeks: its place was eup-
plied by what was called the Old Comedy, with which Horace, in
delendiug his Satires, classes them. The Drama scyram was
1 parodymn tragedy. The Latin word 111110 11 not connected
, with the satyrs or the 11101111 seynae.- it comes frons tha ad·
1001111 solur, ‘lull, hcaped up.’ Hence salaro means originally,
‘a heaping up, mixing together 01 heterogeneous things,’'elther in
offerings made to the gods, or in lawe which embraced various
subjecte per selmum, ‘in the gross or slump! Hence the old
Roman poete Ennius and Pacuvius called a poem written in
various kinds 01 verse, and probably 01 a comio nature, a actara.
Lucilius, about 1111 year 120 nn, retained the name, applying it
to a regular hexameter poem, 01 1111 class now called satiras,
which he divided into thirty books. ’11111 originated the satire,
and Horace expressly mentions Lucilius as its inventor. Horace,
however, made 111 improvement on its character. He gave up
personal attacks, and the assailiug 01 particular individuale: 101
this he made use 01 his Epodes. ln 1111 Satires he laehes not single
sools, but 10011 11 a class-sully generally. The satire with him
is a diductio poam, it gives instruction in the philosophy 01 1111,
and particular persone mentioned are introduced merely as il·‚
lustrativeexamples. There are marked featuresol distinction also
between Horace and his successore as Roman antitiste, Juvenal
and Persius, whose wdrhs are still extant. Lucilius had been
entirely personal, and 'principally politica13 Horace, in another
age and under other politiori circumstances, took only the follies

to teach by showing where error lay. Juvenal inveighs against

This accounts also both⁴sor 111 lact, that his Satires are generally
in the 101111 01 entertaining 1111111111, and 101 the peculiarities ot‘
their language and melre. In style, he keeps as close as possible

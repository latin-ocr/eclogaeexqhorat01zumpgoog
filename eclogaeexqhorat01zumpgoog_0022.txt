smouldering ashes of political rancour, would have to letalip tha
truth‚ and flatterthe ruling party. Under these circumstances,
men of ability took refuge iu poetry and the regiona of fancy; and
little else was heard now in the intellectual circlesof Rome but .
recitatione of poetry and criticisma thereon. Among the dir·
tinguished poeta of the time we may mention especially virgil,
whose charming pastorals had delighted all, and gained for him
the favour and patronage cf Octavianus3 also Varius, who had
recommended himself by a poem on the death of Caesar; and
manyothers, to whom Horace occasionally alludes. Horace, too,
felt an inclination towards poetry: ha says (Epist. ii. 251) that
poverty, which impels men to bold undertakings, had driven him
to attempt verse-making. He sought in poetry the means of sub·
clarence, by writing occasioual verses. These were not directly
paid for, but presente were sentin aclmowledgment of them, aad
they gainedfor him the patronage of wealthy men, on whose
bounty he lived. He scon became known to his brother poeta at
Roma; and first Virgil, then Varius, spoke of him to Maecenas.
The latter invited Horace to visithim, and ashed him a few ques·
tions about his family. Horace answered timidly and modestly.
Maecenas then dismissed him without anydefinite promise; and
it was not till nine months thereafter that he again summoned
him. and made him one of his friends (nmio.) This happened
probably in the beginning of the year 40 a. c. ’
Maecenas has been richly repaid for his lindnass to Horace hy
the praises which the latter everywhere bestowa upon him, and
which have made his namea current word for ‘a patronos litera·
ture! He was one of the most influential men in Rome3 not from
his rank or birth, but purely from his politicalsltill and sagacity.

He was descended from an ancient bur not a noble family ς for Ι

none of his ancestors had held any curule office in Rome. He
was a simple Roman knight, and inclined to romain so: though
often invited to take office, hs always declined, preferring the
quietos private life, which his wealtb enabled him to enj0y‚ to
the activity of a buatling political career. He was the friend
and confidant of Octavianus, whom he aided with his advice and
cooperation in the most critical situations} and to whom he was

. so much attached, that at the time cf the battle of Actium (30

n. n), and previously, when Octavianus was obliged to bo absent
from the city, he underrook the responsible and laborioua office
of praefatur urbi. This confideoce of Octavianus in Maecenas,
being well known to all, raised the latter iu actual power above
most men in the state, and all aspirante tc the emperor's favour
floched to'pay their homage to Maecenas. He was at the sama
time well acquainted with, and had afine taste for literature, and
toolr the despect interest in it. He attempted poetry himself too. ·

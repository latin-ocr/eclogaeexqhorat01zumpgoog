CARMINUM mu. 1.

Partem Falernil Dicat Opuntiae
Frater Megillee‚ quo beatus
Vulnere, qua pereat sagina.

Cesset voluntasl N on alia bibam
Mercede. Quae te cunque domat Venus,
Non erubescendis adurit , 15
Ignibus ingenuoque semper

Amore peccas. Quidquid babes, age,
Depone tutis auribus. Ah, miser,

Quanta laborabas Charybdi,
Digne puer meliore flamma!

Quae saga, quis te solvere Thessalis
Magus venenis, quis poterit deuel
Vix illigatum te triformi
Pegasus expediet Chimaera.

is a laudatiori ot' Augustus. As in the preceding poem Horace
had praised his firmnesa,so berche extols his foresight, pru·
deuse (consiliam), and the essence or substance of the whole ode
is to be found in lines 65-θᾶ Augustus exhibited this prudence
in three distinct ways: first, in the conquest oftlre troops which
opposed him (line 42 to the end), particularly those of Antony,
and Horace represents his battle with him as that of Jupiter
against the giants aud Titans3 aecondly, in his mildness aller
the victory (line 41); and thirdly, in his literary occupations and
enjoyments during peace (lines ³740.) . The giver of this pru-
dence is Calliope, to whom also the poet has dedicated himself.
Hence hi right to sing the emperor’s praises in an ode to the
mnae. 'l'he expansion of this thought forms the introduction
(linea 1-36.) “

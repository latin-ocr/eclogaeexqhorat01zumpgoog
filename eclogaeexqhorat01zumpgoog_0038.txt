Q. nondun ΠιΑοῦῙ

Eritata rotis palmaque nobilis
Terrarum dominos evehit ad deos3
Hunc, si mobilium turba Quiritium
Certat tergeminis tollere honoribus3

Illum, si proprio condidit horreo
Quidquid de Libycis verritur areis.
Gaudentem patrios findere sarculo
Agros Attalicis condicionibus

Nunquam dimoveas, ut trabe Cypria
Myrtoum pavidus nauta secet rnaro.
Luctantem Icariis fluctibus Africum
Mercator metuens, otiurn et oppidi

Laudat rura sui ; mox reficit rates
Quassus, indocilis pauperiem pati.

Est qui nec veteris pocula Massici
Nec partem solido demere pe die 20
